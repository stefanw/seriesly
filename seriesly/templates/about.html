    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Seriesly is about streamlining your TV Show addiction. You don't want to investigate if there was a new episode and you don't want to surf on suspicious sites with ugly ads and popups. You want a reminder for the episodes of your favorite TV Shows delivered to you in your favorite format: as an email, feed item, calendar entry or just on a simple web page. For the nerdy people there is even a Web Hook.</p>
    <p>Seriesly runs on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a>.</p>
